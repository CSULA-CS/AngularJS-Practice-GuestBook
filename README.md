AngularJS-Practice-GuestBook
============================

A simple project that will be used to learn AngularJS

What I want you to do using Github is:
(note: I do know that I didn't get the time to explain to you guys how to use github, therefore, if you are having problem on this part; really, lemme know, I can go over with you hand by hand)

1. Clone the github repo using github software (of course, if you are facing any problem, contact me asap)
2. Create a new branch called it under your name (for example: my branch will be "Eric")
3. Finish the following requirements as you run through the tutorial
4. Push your branch to server

Guest book is what you need to do!
Some sample requirements:

1. post and delete a comment
2. list comments (Think about it like the example I showed in class huh ... ng-repeat?)
3. edit comment

#### Extra
1. style it as how you want it to look, make it as beautiful as you can if you have time
